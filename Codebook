This project uses data from the research "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set"
Information on research is here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Original data can be obtained here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

According to project task, script run_analysis.R uses the following data from the given set:
test_X and train_X, frames with measurement data;
test_y adn train_y, labels of activities;
subject_test and subject_train, lists of test subjects;
features, as names for measured variables;
activity_labels, to match labels with activity names.

The resulting data set contains 180 observations of following 68 variables:
1. "subject": label of the test subject (integer value).
2. "activity": name of the activity, in which measurement were taken (character).
3-68. Average (for subject and activty) data of original research (double). Titles refer to original variable ("features") names; note that here are "average mean" and "average std". Quoting features_info.txt:

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Sample names of those variables:
"tBodyAcc-mean()-X" 
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Y" 
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Z" 
"tBodyAcc-std()-X" 
"tBodyAcc-std()-Y" 
"tBodyAcc-std()-Z"
